### Face Mask detection 
In this project, a face mask detection model that can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not is proposed.
The original dataset used in this project was from Kaggle. Data set consists of 7553 images with 3(RGB) channels in 2 folders as with_mask and without_mask. Images are named as label with_mask and without_mask. There are 3725 images of faces with_mask and 3828 images of faces without mask. The image data input parameters are the number of images, image height, image width, number of channels, and the number of levels per pixel. Typically, we have 3 channels of data corresponding to the colors Red, Green, Blue (RGB) Pixel levels are usually [0,255].
## EDA
The image dimensions were 350 * 525, and the number of channels were 3(RGB). The below picture was randomly selected image from the data set. The image needed to be scaled down 
before building a model.

## Data Preprocessing 
The image dataset needed to be scaled to a standard size of 224 * 224 before modeling. The mean and standard deviation of pixel values were normalized to 0 and 1. The normalization helps the deep leaning models perform better as it helps to get data within a range and reduces the skewness since it’s centered around 0. This helps learn faster and better. The number of color channels were not reduced, and the shape of tensor was (3,224,224). The channel dimension was left as 3 channels for the input layer. The final tensor will be of the form (C * H * W). Along with this, a scaling operation is also performed from the range of 0–255 to 0–1. The dataset was split into training set with 80% of dataset and testing set with 20% of dataset.
## Modeling
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. Pytorch has different ways to create custom CNN model. They are OOP based and Functional based for creating CNN network. In this project, CNN model was developed using object-oriented approach. This allowed to tweak every aspect of the network and could easily visualize the network along with how the forward algorithm works. The ‘Net’ class was created by inheriting the pytorch nn.Module class.The Net class was initialized with Convolutional Layers (conv), pooling, and Fully Connected (fc) layers. 
## Loss function and Optimizer 
After developing the CNN model, we must define the loss function and Optimizer. CrossEntropyLoss from PyTorch is used for training classification problems. It combines SoftMax and Negative Log-Likelihood. Pytorch has ‘optim’ which is an optimization algorithm. The optimizer was constructed using this and it updates the parameters based on the computed gradients. This cycle happens until the training ends. It is basically a fundamental tool for the network to “learn” and update its weights from backpropagation. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used in implementing gradient descent. The parameter to the optimizer was the net.parameters() from the model based on the Net class. Once, we have defined all the functions, the trainloader was passed over the Net model. An ‘epoch’ is one pass over the entire training set one time. The training set was passed over ten time for learning the features.  The training and the testing accuracy of the model was 89% .  The model was tested with random images from the testing set. 
The Figure below shows the actual labels and labels predicted by the model.
